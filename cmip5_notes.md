## Runs

* piControl (pre-industrial control): pre-industrial control run (>500 years)
* historical (historical): similation of recent past (1850-2005)
* historicalNat (natural-only): historical simulation but with natural forcing only (volcanoes, solar variability)
* historicalGHG (GHG-only): historical simultaion but with GHG forcing only
* historicalExt (historical extension): extension of the historical simulation through 2012
* historicalMisc (various combinations of natural and anthropogenic forcings; abbreviations are included in the `forcing` global attribute)  
    * Nat (natural forcing; a combination, not explicitly defined, that might include, for example, solar and volcanic)
    * Ant (anthropogenic forcing; a mixture, not explicitly defined, that might include, for example, well-mixed greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone, and land-use changes)
    * GHG (well mixed greenhouse gases; a mixture, not explicitly defined)
    * AA (anthropogenic aerosols; a mixture of aerosols, not explicitly defined)
    * SD (anthropogenic sulfate aerosol, accounting only for direct effects)
    * SI (anthropogenic sulfate aerosol, accounting only for indirect effects)
    * SA (= SD + SI; anthropogenic sulfate aerosol direct and indirect effects)
    * TO (tropospheric ozone)
    * SO (stratospheric ozone)
    * OZ (ozone; =tropospheric and stratospheric)
    * LU (land-use change)
    * Sl (solar irradiance)
    * Vl (volcanic aerosol)
    * SS (sea salt)
    * Ds (Dust)
    * BC (black carbon)
    * MD (mineral dust)
    * OC (organic carbon)

To find the branch point for where the historical runs depart from the control run,
the information should be in the global history attributes (`branch_time` global attribute).
There's also a `parent_experiment_rip` which might refer to the relevant control run??
Sometimes this information is either missing or wrong, 
so Jonathan Gregory also maintains a [pcmdi-ancestry document](http://pcmdi-cmip.llnl.gov/cmip5/errata/jgregory_cmip5ancestry.txt).
[Here](https://github.com/durack1/cmip5/blob/master/make_cmip5_spawninfo.py) is an example of it being used in Python.

### Model overlap

From [Heuz√© & Heywood (2015)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00381.1):

* ACCESS1.0 has the same atmosphere model code and configuration as HadGEM2 and the same ocean model code as GFDL CM3 and GFDL-ESM2M (but a different configuration).
* CCSM4 and CESM1 (CAM5) have the same ocean model code but use a different atmosphere model code.
* CMCC-CM and CMCC-CMS have the same ocean code and configuration and the same atmosphere code with different configurations.
* GFDL-ESM2G and GFDL-ESM2M share the same atmosphere, land, and sea ice model codes. GFDL-ESM2M and GFDL CM3 share ocean codes that are roughly the same, whereas their atmosphere codes differ.
* GISS-E2-H and GISS-E2-R have the same atmosphere model code but different oceans.
* HadGEM2-ES is basically HadGEM2-CC with the addition of tropospheric chemistry.
* IPSL-CM5A-LR and IPSL-CM5A-MR have the same ocean and atmosphere model codes, but the resolution of the atmosphere is higher in IPSL-CM5A-MR.
* MIROC5 features a more recent version of the ocean model code than MIROC-ESM-CHEM and a different atmosphere model.
* MPI-ESM-LR and MPI-ESM-MR share the same ocean and atmosphere model codes; however, MPI-ESM-MR has a higher horizontal resolution in the ocean and vertical resolution in the atmosphere.


### General model details

#### Aerosol representation

Much of the information on the indirect effects and Ant source come from Wilcox (2013). There's also a table in
[Jones (2013)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgrd.50239/full) which has a good summary.

a: For the GISS E2 models the p1xx anf p3xx are produced by model versions that differ in their treatment of aerosols and atmospheric chemistry (see [here](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/modelE/ar5/) for details) 
b: For this simulation the r and p values were accidentally reversed
c: For the CCSM4 and CESM1-CAM5 models all of the following are included in single forcing runs, but except for the species identified in the simulation shorthand column of the table, they are held fixed or cycled over the annual cycle consistent with 1850 values: GHG, Vl, Sl, LU SS Ds SD BC MD OC Oz and DMS-derived aerosols. Further information about the forcing included in various CCSM4 and CESM1-CAM5 model simulations is available at http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/CMIP5/forcing_information

NCI also has atmospheric historicalMisc data for the BNU-ESM model, which isn't listed by Schmidt2014

### Data issues

#### CanESM2

* Bad volcello data

#### CCSM4

* Bad volcello data
* Some of the CCSM4 piControl sea water salinity data files have units g/kg (as they should), while others (for the same run) have kg/kg (or 1).
* For the CCSM4 model, r6i1p10 of historicalMisc only goes to 1999 (instead of 2005) and there are other experiments (e.g. historicalGHG) where some runs start at 1851 and others at 1850  
* Some of the historicalMisc (r1i1p10) monthly thetao data files have random zeros in places (in the 1860, 1910, 1920 and 1930 files)

#### CSIRO-Mk3-6-0

* In the CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 rcp85 (and probably other experiments) hfbasin data the position of the "global ocean" and "indian pacific ocean" regions are mislabelled. The "global ocean" data is the last of the three regions (i.e. Python index -1 or 2) and "indian pacific ocean" is the middle. 

#### FGOALS-g2

* The time axis units in the FGOALS-g2 data is `days since 0001-01`. The lack of a day specifier causes problems with time related operations in Iris. 

#### GFDL-ESM2M

* For the GFDL-ESM2M historical and historicalAA (r1i1p5) experiments, the parent experiment is listed as historicalMisc when it should be piControl  

#### GISS-E2-H and GISS-E2-R 

* Bad volcello data for GISS-E2-R
* For the GISS-E2-H and GISS-E2-R models, the sea surface salinity (sos) and sea surface temperature (tos) data is on the atmospheric grid rather than the oceanic. This means you need to use areacella instead of areacello.  
* For the GISS-E2-R model (haven't checked E2-H), the ocean surface variables that are on the ocean grid (e.g. hfds, areacello) are missing their land mask (zeros instead of the fill value have been used)
* The Southern Ocean extends a long way north in the GISS-E2-R basin file, so don't use it.  
* The theato, r1i1p1 (haven't checked other variables/runs) piControl data is missing some files. It jumps from 363012 to 398101. The historical data branches at 398101.  
* For the GISS-E2-R model the branch time corresponds to the branch year, not the days since... 

#### IPSL-CM5A-LR

* Bad volcello data

#### MIROC-ESM

* wfo wrong sign (I've only checked piControl, r1i1p1)

#### MIROC-ESM-CHEM

* wfo wrong sign (I've only checked piControl, r1i1p1)

#### NorESM1-M

* Bad volcello data
